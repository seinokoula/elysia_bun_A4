# elysia_bun

elysia_bun is a web application built with ElysiaJS, a fast and friendly web framework designed for the Bun runtime. This application is designed with performance, simplicity, and flexibility in mind, leveraging the power of ElysiaJS and Bun to deliver a high-performance web application.
Features

- ElysiaJS: The application uses ElysiaJS, a web framework designed for the Bun runtime. ElysiaJS provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications, with built-in support for TypeScript and a variety of plugins for extended functionality1.

- Bun Runtime: The Bun runtime is a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It supports TypeScript and JSX out of the box, and it's designed with today's JavaScript ecosystem in mind2.

- Middleware: The application uses several middleware packages to enhance its functionality, including @elysiajs/cors for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), @elysiajs/html for serving HTML content, @elysiajs/jwt for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and @elysiajs/swagger for API documentation.

- Security: The application uses elysia-helmet for setting HTTP headers related to security and elysia-rate-limit for limiting repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints.

- Database: The application uses mongoose for object data modeling (ODM) to manage application data in MongoDB.
